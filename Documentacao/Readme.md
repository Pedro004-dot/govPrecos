GovPrecos is a SaaS for civil servants who are tired of making manual quotes, calling suppliers, and budgeting for products. Our app searches millions of approved bids and provides civil servants with the prices of products that the market is buying. With this process, we are greatly improving civil servant productivity and reducing idle time.
Our big challenge on the front end is how to put our customer at the center, meaning that UX and UI decisions are made with customer productivity in mind.

Our roadmap is
1 feature
A structure where customers can search for prices of items they need to buy and make quotes, either by importing Excel spreadsheets to pull up items or by entering them manually. We can add filters for distance radius and publication time to this search process. The user can edit the quote by adding or removing items, and after selecting the items, they must be able to generate the quote, where we will present a list of collected prices, visual highlights for outliers, and automatic calculations:  average, median, and lowest valid price.
To generate reports, we need to have different types of reports with attractive visuals.

We already have all the routes for the first feature created. You can access the backend documentation to understand this.

New features
Generate a term of reference after the quote is made.
